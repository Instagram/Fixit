:title:`A lint framework that writes better Python code for you.`

Fixit is a lint framework that complements `Flake8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`_.
Itâ€™s based on `LibCST <https://github.com/Instagram/LibCST/>`_ which makes it possible
to provide **auto-fixes**.
Lint rules are made easy to build through pattern matching, a test toolkit,
and utility helpers (e.g. scope analysis) for non-trivial boilerplate.
It is optimized for efficiency, easy to customize and comes with many builtin lint rules.

Getting Started
---------------

To install Fixit::

  pip install fixit

Fixit provides CLI commands.
To run built-in Fixit rules on existing code to get code quality suggestions::

  python -m fixit.cli.run_rules

To apply autofix on existing code::

  python -m fixit.cli.apply_fix

You can learn more about how to `configure Fixit <https://fixit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#Configuration-File>`_,
`build a lint rule <https://fixit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_a_lint_rule.html>`_,
`test a lint rule <https://fixit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_a_lint_rule.html>`_ from our tutorials.

Development
-----------

Start by setting up and activating a virtualenv:

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone git@github.com:Instagram/Fixit.git fixit
    cd fixit
    python3 -m venv ../fixit-env/  # just an example, put this wherever you want
    source ../fixit-env/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip  # optional, if you have an old system version of pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
    # If you're done with the virtualenv, you can leave it by running:
    deactivate

We use `isort <https://isort.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
to format code. To format changes to be conformant, run the following in the root:

.. code-block:: shell

    tox -e autofix

To run all tests, you'll need to install `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
and do the following in the root: (use py37, py38 to choose from Python version 3.7 or 3.8)::

    tox -e py38

You can also run individual unit tests by specifying a module like
this::

    tox -e py38 -- fixit.common.tests.test_report

To run all test cases of a specific rule (e.g. ``NoInheritFromObjectRule``)::

    tox -e py38 -- fixit.tests.NoInheritFromObjectRule

See the `unittest documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_
for more examples of how to run tests.

We use `Pyre <https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check>`_ for type-checking. To
verify types for the library, do the following in the root::

    pyre --preserve-pythonpath check

To generate documentation, do the following in the root:

.. code-block:: shell

    tox -e docs
